This repository contains the source code for the Nouns iOS app. The app was funded by the Nouns DAO under [proposal 6](https://nouns.wtf/vote/6). The goal of this project is to build momentum around Nouns as a cultural phenomenon and to help them reach a wider audience. This repo is meant to serve as a working place for any developers who wish to contribute to the iOS app.
