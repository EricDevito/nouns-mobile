The Safe will be used immediately to recognize existing a few creators in our community while also allowing fast funding of small, one-off, or alpha version projects as they appear.*\\n\\n\\n### Past and Fast\\nWhile Nouns DAO governance works well for larger projects, the multi-step, on-chain proposal process is not ideal for encouraging small, one-off, or alpha versions of projects/tooling. Despite this, many Nouns community members have added to the ecosystem and it would be great to honor their contribution.\\n\\nTo solve both of these issues, we\\'d like to propose that a pool of capital be sent to a Nouners controlled Safe. A Safe is much quicker mechanism to coordinate and distribute funds. We would like 20 ETH to pilot the pool, with a suggested range of 0.25-2 ETH per project, with the aim of:\\n\\n1. acknowledging, through retroactive funding, past contributions to the Nouns ecosystem\\n1. granting funds for the development of small, one-off, or alpha version projects\\n1. encouraging building and signalling that retroactive funding is a viable way to build on Nouns\\n\\n\\n### Funding Committee\\nThe initial signing committee on the Safe will be:\\n- ![](https://bafkreiagjoe5qu3mcl37dwki2vp4fj4gb7kccmflsn2aaf7tzomoe7kw7a.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 12\\n- ![](https://bafkreiffeqnv4rgab7e5o6vmn77ybkp3iuvcgjfu64lpu7yixiwhp7y3ty.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 16\\n- ![](https://bafkreigj6v7xwubod6ustllhc5jjrhpeggzsyrmjodvqgq47zshzh2l3xi.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 22\\n- ![](https://bafkreifald3ya6i62qy3s2mfefbzxnnkb25wazvqlnco3nr4xzuq6a7pae.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 32\\n- ![](https://bafkreiaalajwukk3wfocjcbl6a7uufkcsepeerhvunmnyjewfhnipqn2v4.ipfs.dweb.link/) Nouns DAO\\n\\nThe Safe will require `2 of 4` Nouners to sign, with Nouns DAO acting as a largely symbolic owner and backup.\\n\\nThe committee will monitor the builder community, retroactively fund previous work as it comes up, and receive informal requests/applications for small project grants. The projects and amounts will be at the committee\\'s discretion.\\n\\n\\n### Who to Retro Fund Right Now\\nIn addition to the 20 ETH Safe, we proposal the immediate funding of the following creators:\\n* `1 ETH` to [12BNoun](https://twitter.com/12bnoun) for developing many projects including [Nounspedia](https://twitter.com/12bnoun/status/1441940187794132994?s=20), [This-or-that](https://want2bnoun.herokuapp.com/), and [Synthetic Nouns](https://twitter.com/12bnoun/status/1445013643737776132?s=20)\\n* `0.75 ETH` to [humpstyles](https://twitter.com/humpstyles) for their original, Nouns-based art [Abstract Nouns](https://opensea.io/collection/abstract-nouns)\\n* `0.75 ETH` [Zeeraffe](https://twitter.com/TheZeeraffe), [JustKiddinc](https://twitter.com/justkidddinc), and [WNX](https://twitter.com/syazwanamidun) for continuing to create one [Nouns Vox](https://opensea.io/collection/voxelnouns) daily\\n* `0.25` ETH to [aaaaaaaaaa](https://twitter.com/3pa15) for setting up a [Dune Analytics Dashboard](https://twitter.com/3pa15/status/1439723133586612226?s=20) for Noun Auction stats.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Transaction Details\\nThis proposal will execute the following transactions:\\n- `1 ETH` sent to `12BNoun` ([0xd77e44F294938472381A587a47F5D836C6290EA3](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd77e44F294938472381A587a47F5D836C6290EA3))\\n- `0.75 ETH` sent to `humpstyles` ([0x4939C898da18b0c1E71DC2A42aa545AD228711B5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4939C898da18b0c1E71DC2A42aa545AD228711B5))\\n- `0.75 ETH` sent to the `Nouns Vox` group ([0x6Dfa20170603c53220cDD61EA8d7DE9b7Ed725Ef](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6Dfa20170603c53220cDD61EA8d7DE9b7Ed725Ef))\\n- `0.0125 ETH` sent to `Electronic Frontier Foundation` ([0x095f1fD53A56C01c76A2a56B7273995Ce915d8C4](https://etherscan.io/address/0x095f1fD53A56C01c76A2a56B7273995Ce915d8C4)) on behalf of `aaaaaaaaaa`\\n- `0.0125 ETH` sent `Save The Children` ([0xA77a54139b285C5294f24A492B9896c380dDe01D](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA77a54139b285C5294f24A492B9896c380dDe01D)) on behalf of `aaaaaaaaaa`\\n- `20 ETH` sent to the `Retro Funding/Small Grants Committee\\'s Gnosis Safe` ([0x2AF21E37928613582734bcBAeaD0919801a4CAcf](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2AF21E37928613582734bcBAeaD0919801a4CAcf))\\n- `0.023` ETH sent to `Noun 32` as reimbursement for [creating the Safe](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6c27afac278642ad6512df0ec90a483e59e799e767a17d995830785bda12035d) ([0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d))\\n- `0.088` ETH sent to `Noun 22` as reimbursement for submitting the on-chain proposal ([0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e))",
